# HW2_EGC

- Developed a car race based game using C++, OpenGL and Graphics Design techniques.

- Implemented collision detection with opponents (which are dynamic objects) using the Sphere vs Sphere test.

- Created a complex shape of the road rendering a large density of triangles so that no visual artifacts are generated.

- Designed a curvature effect in Vertex Shader modifying the 'y' coordinate of all the objects' vertices in the scene.
